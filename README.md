# Glossary Search
Python script to search in a glossary. This is a cleaner version of the Psychology branch used for a different textbook.

This one was used to search for definitions in America's History. Feel free to modify any files for personal use.

##  Usage

1. Copy your glossary to a file named `glossary.txt` in the root directory
2. Use `pdfCleanup.py` to clean up the txt (you may need to modify the rules)
3. Run `DefinitionSplitter.py` to create a definitions json file `glossary.json`
5. Make a `terms.txt` file of terms to search
6. Run `Search.py` for a txt output

This version does not support html. Use the `psychology` branch to see html implementation
