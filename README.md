# Glossary Search
Python script to search in a glossary

This one was used to search for definitions in Myers Psychology. Feel free to modify any files for personal use.

##  Usage

1. Copy your glossary to a file named `glossary.txt` in the root directory
2. Use `pdfthing.py` to clean up the txt
3. Run `DefinitionsSplitter.py` to create a definitions file
4. Move `definitions.txt` into `FINAL`
5. Make a `terms.txt` file of terms to search
6. Run `TxtDriver.py` for a txt or `HtmlDriver.py` for an html

You can also move `definitions.txt` into `Script/Source` to use the `Glossary Searcher.bat`
Use `Termsfix.py` to remove page numbers from a terms list (Not necessary with scripts in `FINAL`)
